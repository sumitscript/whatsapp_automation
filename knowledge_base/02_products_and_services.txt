Compatibility: Compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, but its operation is exclusively confined to Google Chrome.
Usage Requirements: Users are required to ensure their Chrome browser is updated, maintain a stable internet connection, and disable all other browser extensions, with only NeoExamShield active during the test. It is not designed for use on mobile devices.
Target Users: Students/candidates taking online tests on the iamneo portal.
Value Proposition: Upholds test integrity by preventing browser-based malpractice, offering a flexible security solution for various assessment criticalities.
Distinguishing iamneo's "Neo" Products from Norton Neo Browser:
It is imperative to clearly differentiate between iamneo's specialized EdTech products—Neobrowser, NeoExamShield, and NeoPAT—and the Norton Neo Browser, a general-purpose web browser. Despite the shared "Neo" branding, their fundamental purposes, functionalities, and target audiences are entirely distinct. The shared nomenclature, despite vastly different functionalities and target markets, creates a potential for brand confusion, particularly for users unfamiliar with either company. For iamneo, this necessitates clear communication in marketing and user onboarding to emphasize their niche in secure EdTech solutions and avoid dilution of their value proposition.

iamneo's specialized EdTech tools: Neobrowser and NeoExamShield are purpose-built for maintaining the integrity of online examinations within educational and corporate settings. NeoPAT extends this focus to comprehensive talent development and placement management. The design of these tools explicitly prioritizes control, security, and assessment fairness. The difference in form factor—Neobrowser as a full application versus NeoExamShield as a Chrome extension—reflects a difference in the depth of system control, allowing iamneo to address varying levels of proctoring needs from moderate (extension-based) to high (dedicated browser).
Norton's general-purpose AI-enhanced web browser: Norton Neo Browser, developed by NortonLifeLock (Gen), is a consumer-oriented web browser designed to enhance general productivity, search capabilities, and online security for everyday users. Its "AI-native" features aim to function as a personal assistant, organize tabs, and provide instant answers to queries. Built on the Chromium framework, it incorporates Norton's established security expertise.
